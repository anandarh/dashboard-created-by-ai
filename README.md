# Modern React Dashboard

A modern dashboard application built with React, designed and implemented with the assistance of AI. This project demonstrates the capabilities of AI-assisted development in creating modern, feature-rich web applications.

## About This AI-Generated Project

This dashboard was created through a collaboration between human developer and AI, showcasing how artificial intelligence can assist in:

- Generating modern UI/UX designs
- Implementing complex features and animations
- Writing clean, maintainable React code
- Creating responsive and interactive components
- Following best practices and design patterns

## AI Development Process

This dashboard was created through an iterative process where AI:

1. Generated the initial project structure
2. Implemented modern UI components
3. Added interactive features and animations
4. Refined the design based on feedback
5. Implemented best practices for React development

## Features

### Authentication

- Beautiful login page with animated gradient background
- Secure authentication system (demo credentials: admin/admin123)
- Protected routes and persistent login state

### Dashboard

- Modern statistics cards with gradient effects
- Interactive charts and graphs using Recharts:
